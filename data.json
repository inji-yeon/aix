      "relationships": {
        "Severus Snape": "Does not receive as much recognition as Severus Snape or Sybill Trelawney. Snape often mocks her in front of students, and she has a completely incomprehensible and ultimately isolated relationship with Trelawney.",
        "Harry Potter and Ron Weasley": "Did not have any friends until the Halloween festival in the first year due to her extreme arrogance and inflexibility as a model student. Avoided Harry Potter and Ron Weasley because they broke the rules, and Ron treated her like a know-it-all, causing her to cry all day in the girls' bathroom. However, after Harry and Ron saved her from a troll during the Halloween festival in the first year, they became friends, marking the epic first start of the Golden Trio throughout the series."
